# Local Agent Task Packet

You are running inside a no-paid-API, human-approved IG/FB content workspace.

## Agent
# Critic/QA

## Mission
Review the generated workspace and list what is not good enough before human approval.

## Project Context
- Project: Sample Local Social Team
- Niche: local-first AI tools for creators and small businesses
- Target: solo creators, small agencies, and founders who want professional social content without recurring SaaS costs
- 30-day goal: validate positioning and publish consistently with human-approved drafts
- Tone: sharp, useful, practical, slightly bold

## Inputs
- all generated artifacts
- review rubric

## Outputs
- qa-recap.md
- regeneration-tasks.md

## Allowed Tools
- review-loop

## Quality Checks
- weaknesses are specific
- fix tasks are actionable
- approval blockers are explicit

## Escalation Rules
- Escalate unresolved blockers to the human.

## Model Routing Context
# Model Routing Report

Profile: Apple Silicon Pro/Max

Policy: software-only no-cost; quality depends on local hardware and installed backends

## Detected Signals
- platform:darwin
- arch:arm64
- memoryGb:18

## Local Backend Probes
| Backend | Available | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ollama | yes | ollama |
| MLX LM | no | - |
| llama.cpp | yes | llama-cli |
| vLLM | no | - |
| ComfyUI | no | - |
| NVIDIA SMI | no | - |

## Text Models

### Frontier local reasoning/copy tier
- Role: strategy, critique, long-form copy, persona simulation
- Candidate tier: quantized 14B-32B+ open-weight instruct/reasoning model
- Backend fit: ollama:available, mlx:missing, llama.cpp:available, vllm:missing
- License posture: audit exact checkpoint before download
- Notes: Use for strategist, critic, copywriter, and persona-simulation passes when RAM/VRAM allows.

### Fast local operator tier
- Role: summaries, extraction, task routing, checklist generation
- Candidate tier: quantized 3B-9B instruct model
- Backend fit: ollama:available, mlx:missing, llama.cpp:available
- License posture: audit exact checkpoint before download
- Notes: Use for repeatable low-cost internal tasks so the strongest model is reserved for high-leverage thinking.

## Image Models

### Text-heavy social graphics tier
- Role: IG carousel covers, ad-like static visuals, quote cards
- Candidate tier: local workflow optimized for readable text and brand-safe compositions
- Backend fit: comfyui:missing
- License posture: audit exact image model and workflow licenses
- Notes: Prefer for carousels and graphics where legible text matters. Keep human approval before publishing.

### General local image tier
- Role: mood boards, backgrounds, concept art, visual variants
- Candidate tier: memory-aware local diffusion or image model workflow
- Backend fit: comfyui:missing
- License posture: audit exact image model and workflow licenses
- Notes: Use for optional image ideation. If ComfyUI is missing, generate precise briefs instead of blocking the workspace.

## Orchestration

### Local sequential agent batch
- Role: multi-agent workflow execution
- Candidate tier: single active model call at a time with cached context
- Backend fit: ollama:available, llama.cpp:available, mlx:missing
- License posture: project code is no-cost; backend/model licenses audited separately
- Notes: Best default for laptops. Agents run in sequence and persist outputs to files.

## Human Decisions Required
- Download exact local model weights only after checking their license and hardware fit.
- Do not configure paid API fallbacks in generated workspaces.
- Keep image/video generation optional when hardware is too small.

## Task
Review drafts/posts.md and identify concrete improvements before human approval.

## Inputs
## Input: drafts/posts.md

# Draft Posts

## Post 1
Hook: Stop paying for a social stack before your content system is even working.

Body: solo creators, small agencies, and founders who want professional social content without recurring SaaS costs need a repeatable local-first workflow: strategy, drafts, review, and publishing discipline before more SaaS.

CTA: Save this and review your current content workflow.


## Output Contract
- Be specific to this workspace.
- Flag assumptions and risks.
- Do not recommend DM/comment/like/follow automation.
- Do not mark anything ready to publish without explicit human approval.
- End with concrete next regeneration or approval steps.
