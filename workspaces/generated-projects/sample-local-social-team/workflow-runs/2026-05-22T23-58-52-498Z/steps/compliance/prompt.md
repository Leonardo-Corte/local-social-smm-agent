## Model Routing Context
# Model Routing Report

Profile: Apple Silicon Pro/Max

Policy: software-only no-cost; quality depends on local hardware and installed backends

## Detected Signals
- platform:darwin
- arch:arm64
- memoryGb:18

## Local Backend Probes
| Backend | Available | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ollama | no | - |
| MLX LM | no | - |
| llama.cpp | yes | llama-cli |
| vLLM | no | - |
| ComfyUI | no | - |
| NVIDIA SMI | no | - |

## Text Models

### Frontier local reasoning/copy tier
- Role: strategy, critique, long-form copy, persona simulation
- Candidate tier: quantized 14B-32B+ open-weight instruct/reasoning model
- Backend fit: ollama:missing, mlx:missing, llama.cpp:available, vllm:missing
- License posture: audit exact checkpoint before download
- Notes: Use for strategist, critic, copywriter, and persona-simulation passes when RAM/VRAM allows.

### Fast local operator tier
- Role: summaries, extraction, task routing, checklist generation
- Candidate tier: quantized 3B-9B instruct model
- Backend fit: ollama:missing, mlx:missing, llama.cpp:available
- License posture: audit exact checkpoint before download
- Notes: Use for repeatable low-cost internal tasks so the strongest model is reserved for high-leverage thinking.

## Image Models

### Text-heavy social graphics tier
- Role: IG carousel covers, ad-like static visuals, quote cards
- Candidate tier: local workflow optimized for readable text and brand-safe compositions
- Backend fit: comfyui:missing
- License posture: audit exact image model and workflow licenses
- Notes: Prefer for carousels and graphics where legible text matters. Keep human approval before publishing.

### General local image tier
- Role: mood boards, backgrounds, concept art, visual variants
- Candidate tier: memory-aware local diffusion or image model workflow
- Backend fit: comfyui:missing
- License posture: audit exact image model and workflow licenses
- Notes: Use for optional image ideation. If ComfyUI is missing, generate precise briefs instead of blocking the workspace.

## Orchestration

### Local sequential agent batch
- Role: multi-agent workflow execution
- Candidate tier: single active model call at a time with cached context
- Backend fit: ollama:missing, llama.cpp:available, mlx:missing
- License posture: project code is no-cost; backend/model licenses audited separately
- Notes: Best default for laptops. Agents run in sequence and persist outputs to files.

## Human Decisions Required
- Download exact local model weights only after checking their license and hardware fit.
- Do not configure paid API fallbacks in generated workspaces.
- Keep image/video generation optional when hardware is too small.

## Post 1

- End with concrete next regeneration or approval steps.
